- [Full Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YElszKFvWJETMz1jjPP2qGpzgasPqsWPXKKxHxnfZ80/edit?tab=t.0)

## System Description
- **Hardware**: Powerful CPU processor with 128GB of memory.
- **Operating System**: Latest version of **Linux**.
- **Database**: MySQL database management system.
- **Network**: Stable network connection using **IPv4**.
- **Security**: SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

## Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment focuses on the current **access controls** of the system. The assessment will cover the period from **January 2025** to **March 2025**. The [**NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA) guidelines are used to guide the **risk analysis** of the information system.

## Purpose
The database is crucial to the business, as employees globally access it to find potential customers. Securing this data is vital to prevent major disruptions to the companyâ€™s operations. If this server is disabled, employees will be unable to work efficiently, which could severely disrupt the business.

## Risk Assessment

### Threat Sources & Risk Analysis

| **Threat Source**  | **Threat Event**                                                        | **Likelihood** | **Severity** | **Risk** |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| Competitor        | Obtaining sensitive data as the database is available to the public.    | 2              | 2            | 4        |
| Threat Actor      | DoS attacks on the server disrupting company operations.                | 1              | 3            | 3        |
| Employee          | Altering or deleting critical information in the database, either accidentally or intentionally. | 2              | 3            | 6        |

### Approach
- **Competitors**: A plausible threat, as the data is publicly available. Competitors could attempt to access and steal sensitive information for financial gain.
- **Threat Actor**: While unlikely, a **DoS (Denial of Service)** attack could disrupt operations as employees rely heavily on the database for their work.
- **Employees**: A significant risk due to access control challenges, especially when employees are spread across the globe. Inadequate access controls may lead to accidental or intentional modification or deletion of critical data.

## Remediation Strategy

### For Employees:
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Limit access to critical data and actions to only those who need it to perform their tasks. This will prevent accidental or malicious alterations or deletions of important data.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Implement MFA to enhance security, ensuring that even if employee accounts are compromised, unauthorized access will be blocked due to the second layer of authentication.

### For Competitors:
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted, both in transit and at rest, to prevent unauthorized access by external parties.

### For Threat Actors:
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Set up an IDS to detect potential DoS attacks and other malicious activities on the server to mitigate disruptions.
